                Hello, my name is Eunseo Park and I am studying computer programming at Seneca College in Canada.
                I love to travel. It's exciting to go to new places and do things I've never experienced before.
                That's why I'm studying computer programming, something I've never done before. Also, as an international student, it's not easy to study alone in Canada, far away from Korea, but I'm trying to live one day at a time.
            </p>
            <p>
                I chose chess because I remember my father teaching me to play when I was younger. He bought me a chessboard as a gift, and I've had fun playing chess ever since. 
                If you've never played chess before, or if you've been curious but never learned, I hope this website will give you a fresh start.
                <br>
                Thank you.
            </p>
