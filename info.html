            <h2>Rules and How to Play</h2>
            <p>The game of chess is played on a square board with 64 squares arranged in an 8x8 grid. Each player starts with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. The goal of the game is to checkmate the opponent's king, which means the king is in a position to be captured and there is no legal move for the opponent to escape the capture.</p>
